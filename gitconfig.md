You're seeing that error (`zsh: command not found: y`) because you typed `y` at the command line, probably thinking it was a response to something inside `nano`. Here‚Äôs a breakdown and what to do next:

---

### ‚úÖ What You Did:

You typed:

```bash
nano ~/.gitconfig
```

This opens the Git configuration file in the `nano` text editor.

Then, when you exited `nano`, you probably meant to save changes and typed `y`‚Äîbut accidentally typed `y` **after** you exited \`nano\*\*, back at the command prompt.

### ‚öôÔ∏è What To Check Next

1. **See if your Git config actually has any info:**

```bash
cat ~/.gitconfig
```

2. **If it‚Äôs empty or doesn‚Äôt show your GitHub identity, add it manually:**

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Full Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
```

3. **Then confirm again:**

```bash
cat ~/.gitconfig
```

You should see:

```ini
[user]
  name = Your Full Name
  email = your@email.com
```

### üß† Pro Tip:

If you're using multiple GitHub accounts (e.g., personal vs. Ukubona), you‚Äôll eventually want **per-project Git configs** and SSH key management. But for now, the global config gets you rolling.

Want help setting up multiple GitHub identities (e.g., for `hades@` and `abikesa@`) in the same machine? I recommend that, especially for clean GitHub auth and commits.
