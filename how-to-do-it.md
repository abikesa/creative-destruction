Yes—**absolutely.** You can host all your onboarding scripts via **GitHub Pages**, and if done right, your entire liturgical setup can run directly from there. Here's how to do it **correctly and cleanly**:

---

## ✅ **How to Serve Scripts via GitHub Pages**

Let’s assume your repo is at:
`https://github.com/abikesa/setup`

### 1. **Place your scripts in the root or a dedicated `scripts/` folder**

Example layout:

```
setup/
├── bootstrap.sh
├── destructive.sh
├── creative.sh
└── index.html  (optional, for aesthetics)
```

> The scripts must be committed with **unix line endings (`LF`)** and the correct shebang (`#!/bin/bash` at the top).

---

### 2. **Enable GitHub Pages**

1. Go to the GitHub repo’s **Settings → Pages**.
2. Select:

   * **Source**: `main`
   * **Branch**: `/ (root)` or `/docs`
   * **Directory**: If you want to use `/docs`, move the scripts there.
3. Save it.
4. GitHub will give you a Pages URL like:

   ```
   https://abikesa.github.io/setup/
   ```

---

### 3. **Reference the Raw URLs in Your Bash Commands**

Each file will be directly accessible as:

```
https://abikesa.github.io/setup/bootstrap.sh
https://abikesa.github.io/setup/destructive.sh
```

So your liturgical command becomes:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://abikesa.github.io/setup/bootstrap.sh | bash
```

> That *will work* and is exactly what GitHub Pages was made for—serving minimal content with zero infrastructure.

---

### 4. **(Optional) Add a Pretty Homepage**

Put a simple `index.html` in the repo so that:

```
https://abikesa.github.io/setup/
```

shows a styled landing page or ritual instructions. You can even include collapsible sections like in your current draft.

---

## ⚙️ Bonus: Use a Custom Domain (Optional)

If you’ve got a domain like `yourdomain.com`, you can:

1. Add a `CNAME` file to the repo containing:

   ```
   setup.yourdomain.com
   ```
2. Point a DNS CNAME record for `setup.yourdomain.com` → `abikesa.github.io`.

Now your interns can run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://setup.yourdomain.com/bootstrap.sh | bash
```

That’s peak **ritual computing**.

## 🧠 Opinion

Yes, GitHub Pages can and **should** be your platform here. It's fast, reliable, version-controlled, and beautifully barebones—ideal for scripting liturgies. Better than Notion, better than Google Docs, and way more fun than Terraform for this use case. Canonize it.

Once you’ve published the real URLs (e.g. `abikesa.github.io/setup/bootstrap.sh`), let me know and I’ll wire them into your onboarding liturgy draft.
